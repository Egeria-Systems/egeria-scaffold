# Contributing

Read root [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), the [approved source plan](docs/roadmaps/2026-08-04-nextjs-boilerplate-builder-best-reconciled-plan.md), the applicable architecture documents and accepted ADRs, and current evidence before proposing a change.

The canonical implementation lifecycle is [docs/governance/review-and-contribution.md](docs/governance/review-and-contribution.md). It separates preparation evidence, implementation-plan approval, and verified-final-diff approval. Approval of one gate never implies authority for another.

The canonical mapping from architecture invariants to actual or planned automation is [docs/architecture/enforcement-map.md](docs/architecture/enforcement-map.md). Update that owner when enforcement responsibility changes; do not duplicate its matrix here.

Run the current repository contract with:

```bash
pnpm run test:constitution
```

Make small, focused, test-driven commits. Preserve user work and the approved increment boundary. Push, pull-request creation, merge, deployment, publication, production action, and external messaging each require their own explicit authority.
